 AWS Security Groups and NACL Demonstration

Overview:

This demonstration showcases the implementation of AWS Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to enhance network security for Amazon EC2 instances. It provides a practical example of how to configure and manage these security features within the AWS cloud environment.

Features:

 Security Groups: 
   Acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances.
   Controls inbound and outbound traffic based on specified rules.
   Stateful rules that automatically allow corresponding outbound traffic.

 Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):
 
   Operates at the subnet level as a stateless traffic filter.
   Allows or denies traffic based on a numbered list of rules.
   Each subnet can have only one NACL, but multiple subnets can share it.

Getting Started
1. Prerequisites:
   
    An AWS account.
    Basic knowledge of AWS services, particularly EC2 and VPC.

2. Usage:
   
    Launch EC2 instances with the configured Security Groups.
    Apply NACLs to the relevant subnets and test traffic flow.
